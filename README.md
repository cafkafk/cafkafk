```
The Guild navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal
decision: they'd chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever downward
into stagnation.
```
```
The thoughts of others
Were light and fleeting,
Of contributors meeting
Or sponsors or fame.

Mine were of semver,
And mine were steady,
So I was ready
When breakage came.
